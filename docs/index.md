<b>TL;DR</b> We present GoLLIE, a Large Language Model trained to follow annotation guidelines. GoLLIE outperforms previous approaches on zero-shot Information Extraction and allows the user to perform inferences with annotation schemas defined on the fly. Different from previous approaches, GoLLIE is able to follow detailed definitions and does not only rely on the knowledge already encoded in the LLM. Code and models are publicly available.

Information Extraction (IE) is a challenging task, often requiring to follow strict and highly detailed guidelines in order to perform the task correctly. Traditionally, large amounts of annotations were used to train models to mimic expert annotators. This approach, however, is very expensive and rarely applicable in low-resource domains. Since several years ago, data-augmentation techniques like Distant Supervision [<a href="#references">1</a>] were developed to tackle data-scarcity. More recently, with the recent advances in NLP, zero and few-shot methods (cite something) were created exploiting the internal knowledge of LLMs.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Despite the recent advances, the models still struggle with guidelines details. We hypothesize that the main reason why that occurs is because models have a strong representation of what the labels mean, and, when more details are needed, the models just ignore them. For instance, this is an example of ChatGPT annotating person entities:
</p>

<table border="0">
 <tr>
   <td><img src="assets/user.svg" width="80em"></td>
   <td>Can you annotate person entities if I give you a sentence? The "person" entity is defined as follows: "Each distinct person, or set of people, mentioned in a document refers to an entity of type Person. For example, people may be specified by name ("John Smith"), occupation ("the butcher"), family relation ("mum"), pronoun ("they"), etc., or by some combination of these."</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<table border="0">
 <tr>
   <td>Certainly, I can help you annotate person entities in a sentence based on the definition you provided. Please provide the sentence you'd like me to annotate for person entities, and I'll do my best to identify and annotate them for you.</td>
   <td><img src="assets/openai.svg" width="50px"></td>
 </tr>
</table>

<table border="0">
 <tr>
   <td><img src="assets/user.svg" width="25em"></td>
   <td>Sentence: "I go from Lasarte to Donosti to work at the University of the Basque Country every day."</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<table border="0">
 <tr>
   <td>In the sentence you provided, there are <b>no explicit mentions of distinct persons or people</b> by name, occupation, family relation, <b>pronoun</b>, or any combination of these. Therefore, there are no person entities to annotate in this sentence. If you have any other sentences or text where you'd like person entities annotated, please feel free to provide them, and I'll assist you accordingly.</td>

 </tr>

<p align="justify">Although the given sentence is quite easy to annotate, the example above shows that even when prompted with the instructions to annotate <b>pronouns</b> as person entities, ChatGPT ignores the instruction and forgets to annotate "I" as person. This imposes a problem when detailed instructions are needed to perform the task, something common on the field of IE where the task guidelines have lots of details and exceptions.</p>

<p align="justify">To address these issues, we present <img src="../assets/GoLLIE.png" width="20"> GoLLIE, a Large Language Model trained to follow annotation guidelines. outperforms previous approaches on zero-shot Information Extraction and allows the user to perform inferences with annotation schemas defined on the fly. Different from previous approaches, GoLLIE is able to follow detailed definitions and does not only rely on the knowledge already encoded in the LLM. Code and models are publicly available. In the following sections we will introduce in more detail how the model works, and show some interesting insights. However, we recommend the reader to read the <a href="">paper</a> for more details.</p>


## Schema definition and inference

<p align="justify">Our model allows the user to define custom schemas using Python code! Python classes allows to write human-readable code that is also familiar with current LLMs. Imagine that we want to extract information about space missions, the following Python code will define the guidelines for two <b>new types</b> of entities: <code>Launcher</code> and <code>Mission</code>.</p>

```python
@dataclass
class Launcher(Template):
    """Refers to a vehicle designed primarily to transport payloads from the Earth's 
    surface to space. Launchers can carry various payloads, including satellites, 
    crewed spacecraft, and cargo, into various orbits or even beyond Earth's orbit. 
    They are usually multi-stage vehicles that use rocket engines for propulsion."""

    mention: str  
    """
    The name of the launcher vehicle. 
    Such as: "Sturn V", "Atlas V", "Soyuz", "Ariane 5"
    """
    space_company: str # The company that operates the launcher. Such as: "Blue origin", "ESA", "Boeing", "ISRO", "Northrop Grumman", "Arianespace"
    crew: List[str] # Names of the crew members boarding the Launcher. Such as: "Neil Armstrong", "Michael Collins", "Buzz Aldrin"
    

@dataclass
class Mission(Template):
    """Any planned or accomplished journey beyond Earth's atmosphere with specific objectives, 
    either crewed or uncrewed. It includes missions to satellites, the International 
    Space Station (ISS), other celestial bodies, and deep space."""
    
    mention: str
    """
    The name of the mission. 
    Such as: "Apollo 11", "Artemis", "Mercury"
    """
    date: str # The start date of the mission
    departure: str # The place from which the vehicle will be launched. Such as: "Florida", "Houston", "French Guiana"
    destination: str # The place or planet to which the launcher will be sent. Such as "Moon", "low-orbit", "Saturn"

```

<p align="justify">Here, the labels are represented as Python classes, and the guidelines or instructions are introduced as docstrings. For some tasks, we would also like to have some additional information about our mentions, like, for example, the <code>space_company</code> or the <code>crew</code> of the launcher. We can add that additional information as attributes of the task, with their corresponding guideline as comments.</p>

<p align="justify">Once we defined our new labels, it is time to provide the model with some texts to annotate. We can do that by simply creating a Python variable with the name <code>text</code> and assign our desired text to it. We can also add a comment to help the model understand what we want. In addition, we recommend to use code formatters like <a href="">Black</a> to standarize the input.</p>

```python
# This is the text to analyze
text = (
    "The Ares 3 mission to Mars is scheduled for 2032. The Starship rocket build by SpaceX will take off from Boca Chica,"
    "carrying the astronauts Max Rutherford, Elena Soto, and Jake Martinez."
)
```

After this, we just need to run the model to generate our annotations!
```python
result = [
    Mission(mention='Ares 3', date='2032', departure='Boca Chica', destination='Mars'),
    Launcher(mention='Starship', space_company='SpaceX', crew=['Max Rutherford', 'Elena Soto', 'Jake Martinez'])
]
```

<p align="justify">As you can see, the generated output can be directly evaluated as it is Python working code. This allows the user to directly parse and interpret the output. The model's output also satisfy the type constraints defined in the guidelines, for instance, we defined every attribute as strings, except for the crew, which is a list. Another constraints can also be applied, such as <code>Optional</code> attributes or more detailed types like <code>Name</code>, <code>Value</code> or <code>String</code> types.</p>

Please, have a look to our <a href="">Notebooks</a> to get started with the model.

## Evaluation

<p align="justify">We have evaluated GoLLIE on a set of diverse tasks across different datasets. Our primary goal is the zero-shot evaluation, although we also report the results obtained on the supervised datasets in the <a href="">paper</a>. The following figure shows a great summary of what our model is capable of:</p> 

![Zero-Shot NER Results.](../assets/zero_shot_results.png)

<p align="justify">We compared our model with GPT-3.5[<a href="#references">2</a>] and Instruct-UIE[<a href="#references">33</a>] (SOTA) on MIT Movie[<a href="#references">4</a>], MIT Restaurant[<a href="#references">5</a>] and CrossNER[<a href="#references">6</a>] Named Entity Recognition (NER)datasets. Our model outperforms previous approaches on almost all the datasets, and performs similar to the SOTA on the rest. In addition to those results showed in the figure, we also evaluated the model on Event Extraction (EE) and Event Argument Extraction (EAE) datasets. Please, check the <a href="">paper</a> or run the <a href="">models</a> yourself for more detailed results.</p>

## Conclusions

We present the first model that properly leverages annotation guidelines to improve zero-shot Information Extraction. Our model, released on 7B, 13B and, 34B variants achieve a new state-of-the-art outperforming previous approaches. For this first release, we focused on probing that teaching LLMs to follow guidelines is be beneficial on low-resource scenarios. For the future, we aim to train the model with many more datasets (similar to other approaches) in order to scale the capabilities of the model.
